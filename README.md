Employing exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, an effective cancer prediction machine learning model can accurately assess an individual's cancer risk at a relatively low cost. By leveraging EDA to uncover patterns and insights within the data, this model can provide reliable and personalized cancer risk evaluations. The data for this analysis is sourced from the online lung cancer prediction system's website, offering a convenient and accessible platform for gathering the necessary information to train and validate the model.
